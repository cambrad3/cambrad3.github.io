# Project Title: Predicting NBA Career Performance Based on Rookie Season
## Sungeun An, Nazanin Anaraki, Cameron Bradley, Kevin Cho, Kalyan Chakravarthi Murahari

### Introduction
#### What are we trying to accomplish?
Forecast a player’s career win shares (number of wins attributable to a player) per season based on their rookie metrics.

#### Why is it important?
NBA teams win or lose games based on the number of win shares their players create. Being able to predict the career performance of a player in their rookie season is important to team management because it allows them to make better draft, trade, and personnel decisions to give their organization the best opportunity to win a championship.

### Data

#### What are its characteristics?
- All players who were rookies between 1980 through 2018 were included in the dataset.
- Each row (2,217) corresponds to an individual player.
- The features include 23 rookie metrics and 20 career metrics.
- Features include information about player efficiency rating, true shooting percentage, 3 point attempt rate, free throw attempt rate, rebound percentage, block percentage, assist percentage, steal percentage, etc. (see Appendix - Glossary of Features) 

### What is Our Approach?
The approach was 2 fold...

#### Unsupervised
We used clustering analysis to find groups of seasoned players (10+ years in the NBA) to which to compare rookie players. To do this we found 2 new features, using LDA, that reduced the dimensions of the rookie and career features into single metrics. These new features were correlated with rookie and career win shares, and used for clustering analysis.

#### Supervised
The main purpose of supervised learning in our project is to predict the career winshares of a player by using their rookie data. We went through different analysis approaches to pick the most important features in the rookie matrix. Furthermore these features were used by various models. Further analysis was done by comparing the rmse, r^2 ad mean squared error values generated by these models.  

#### What is new in our approach?
Using LDA to create new features that reduced the dimensions of the rookie and career features into single metrics, and then using these metrics to predict career performance is novel in our approach.

### Unsupervised
#### Approach Details
Created a new variable, **rookie win shares classifier**. This variable had a value of 0 if the player’s rookie win shares were 1 standard deviation below the mean, 1 if the player’s rookie win shares were within a standard deviation of the mean, and 2 if the player’s rookie win shares were 1 standard deviation above the mean.

For players who were not rookies in 2018, we created a similar metric for **normalized career win shares** (divided by number of years played in the NBA).

Using the rookie win shares classifier as a label, we used **LDA** as a dimension reduction technique to find a **linear combination of the rookie features** that were **predictive of rookie win shares**.

We also created a **LDA** model for **normalized career win shares**.

The first component of the rookie LDA model and the first component of the career LDA model were used as a new set of features for clustering analysis. The **first components** were chosen because they are the features **most responsible in their models for maximizing win share class separability**.

The following plot shows how the original rookie and career features are correlated with the values of the chosen LDA components.

kalyan's stuff:
The correlation matrix is shown below. By analyzing it, we picked the features that correlated the most to the winshares.

The selected features were used by different models. we performed linear regression on the selected features.

#### Evaluation of Approach
Nazanin, Kevin, Kalyan

The rmse, r^2 and mean squared error values were used to compare the performance of different models.
->rmse and r^2 comparison goes here

After analysis and comparison between different models, we picked the best model for further analysis on players. In this approach We picked 10 players and predicted their corresponding career winshares, using their rookie features for the selected model. Furthermore, we used these predicted winshares, and predicted which player in our current dataset they will most likely have the closest winshares to, in their future career.-> I need to revise this sentence.

->10 players comparison table will go here.
